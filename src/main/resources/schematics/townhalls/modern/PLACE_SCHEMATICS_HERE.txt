Place your modern town hall schematics here.

Required files:
- level_1.schem (or .schematic)
- level_2.schem (or .schematic)
- level_3.schem (or .schematic)
- ... up to level_10.schem

These schematics will be used when players create or upgrade their modern town halls.

Tips:
- Use WorldEdit to create and save your schematics
- Make sure the origin point is at the base center of the structure
- Scale structures appropriately for each level (level 1 = small, level 10 = large)
- Use modern-themed blocks like quartz, concrete, iron blocks, glass, etc.
- Consider clean, geometric designs with advanced materials

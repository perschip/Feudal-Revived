Place your nexus schematics here.

Required files:
- medieval_nexus.schem (or .schematic)
- fantasy_nexus.schem (or .schematic)
- modern_nexus.schem (or .schematic)

These schematics will be used when nexus structures are built for kingdoms.

Tips:
- Use WorldEdit to create and save your schematics
- Make sure the origin point is at the base center of the structure
- Nexus structures should be smaller than town halls (recommended 5x5x5 to 10x10x10)
- Include a beacon or distinctive central block to represent the nexus core
- Match the theme of the corresponding town hall type:
  * Medieval: Stone, beacon, medieval materials
  * Fantasy: Purpur, amethyst, magical materials
  * Modern: Quartz, concrete, sleek materials
